# AllerFree Privacy Policy
AllerFree Terms of Agreement and Privacy Policy
Terms of Agreement
## 1. Introduction
Welcome to AllerFree, a mobile application designed to assist users in identifying potential allergens in food products through barcode scanning and to provide air quality information based on geolocation. By downloading, installing, or using AllerFree, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Agreement ("Terms"). If you do not agree with these Terms, please do not use the application.
## 2. Purpose and Functionality
AllerFree is a tool intended to help users make informed decisions about food consumption and environmental exposure, particularly for those with dietary sensitivities, allergies, or respiratory concerns. The application offers the following key features:

Barcode Scanning: Scans product barcodes to retrieve and analyze ingredient lists from external data sources, flagging potential allergens such as milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, and soybeans.
Air Quality Monitoring: Provides air quality index (AQI) data based on the user’s location, offering general recommendations for individuals with respiratory sensitivities.
Allergy Profile: Allows users to input and save their allergy information locally on their device.
Scan History: Stores a history of scanned barcodes and their results locally on the device.
Settings and Support: Enables customization of app appearance and provides a contact option for user support.

## 3. Limitations of Service
AllerFree is a supplementary tool and not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Please note the following limitations:

Accuracy: The accuracy of ingredient and allergen information depends on external data sources (e.g., Barcode Lookup API, Edamam API, Open Food Facts API, AirNow API), which may contain errors, omissions, or outdated information. AllerFree does not guarantee the completeness or accuracy of the data provided.
Allergen Detection: The application may not identify all possible allergens, especially rare or highly personalized sensitivities, or those not explicitly listed in ingredient data.
Air Quality Data: AQI information is sourced from external providers and is intended for general informational purposes only. It may not reflect real-time conditions or account for localized variations.
No Medical Advice: AllerFree does not diagnose allergies, assess the severity of allergic reactions, or provide medical evaluations. Users should consult qualified healthcare professionals for personalized allergy management and health advice.

## 4. User Responsibilities
By using AllerFree, you agree to:

Verify ingredient and allergen information independently (e.g., by checking product labels) before consuming any food product.
Consult with healthcare professionals for advice on allergies, dietary restrictions, or respiratory health.
Grant necessary permissions (e.g., camera access for barcode scanning, location access for air quality data) for the app to function as intended.
Use the application responsibly and understand its limitations as a non-medical tool.

Privacy Policy
## 1. Introduction
At AllerFree, we are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency in how we handle your data. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding your data. By using AllerFree, you consent to the practices described in this policy.
## 2. Information We Collect
AllerFree collects the following types of information:

Personal Information:
Name: First and last name (optional) provided during the setup process, stored locally on your device via UserDefaults.
Allergy Profile: List of allergies entered in the Profile View, stored locally on your device via UserDefaults.
Scan History: Records of scanned barcodes, including barcode numbers, scan results, and timestamps, stored locally on your device via UserDefaults.


Device Information:
Camera Access: Used for barcode scanning, with your explicit permission.
Location Data: Used to fetch air quality data based on your geolocation, with your explicit permission. Location data is only accessed when the Air Quality View is active and is not stored.


Non-Personal Information:
App Settings: Preferences such as icon color, stored locally on your device via UserDefaults.
API Requests: When fetching product or air quality data, the app sends barcode numbers or location coordinates to third-party APIs (e.g., Barcode Lookup, Edamam, Open Food Facts, AirNow). These requests do not include personally identifiable information unless explicitly provided by you.



## 3. How We Use Your Information
AllerFree uses your information to:

Provide core functionality, such as scanning barcodes to retrieve ingredient data and displaying air quality information.
Store your allergy profile and scan history locally to personalize your experience and track past scans.
Allow customization of app appearance based on your settings.
Facilitate support requests when you contact us via email through the Contact Support feature.

## 4. Data Storage and Security

Local Storage: All personal information (name, allergy profile, scan history, settings) is stored locally on your device using UserDefaults. This data is not transmitted to any servers or external systems controlled by the developer(s).
Security: We take reasonable measures to protect data stored on your device, such as adhering to Apple’s security guidelines for iOS applications. However, no method of storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security of data stored locally on your device.

## 5. Data Sharing
AllerFree does not sell, trade, or share your personal information with third parties, except as described below:

Third-Party APIs: When you scan a barcode or access air quality data, the app sends barcode numbers or location coordinates to third-party APIs (e.g., Barcode Lookup, Edamam, Open Food Facts, AirNow). These APIs may have their own privacy policies, which govern their use of the data. We do not control or assume responsibility for their practices.
Support Requests: If you contact support via email, your email address and message content will be sent to our support email (admin@MUNCHCOMPANY.com) and may be processed by your email provider.

## 6. Your Rights and Choices

Permissions: You can manage camera and location permissions through your device’s Settings app. Denying these permissions may limit certain app features (e.g., barcode scanning or air quality data).
