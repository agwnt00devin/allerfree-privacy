## 1. Information We Collect
We collect the following types of information:

- **Scan History**: Barcode scans and their results (e.g., allergen status) are stored locally on your device.

### Non-Personal Information
- **Location Data**: If you enable location services, we collect your device’s approximate location (latitude and longitude) to provide air quality information.
- **Camera Access**: The App uses your camera for barcode scanning. No images are stored or transmitted.

### iCloud Data
- If you enable iCloud syncing, certain data (e.g., allergy profiles, scan history) may be stored in iCloud to sync across your devices.
